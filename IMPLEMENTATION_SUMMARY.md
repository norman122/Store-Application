5. Deep linking works from both foreground and background states

## ðŸ§ª Testing

### **Test Commands Available:**

- See `test-deeplink.md` for comprehensive testing commands
- Android: `adb shell` commands for testing deep links
- iOS: `xcrun simctl` commands for testing deep links

### **Manual Testing Steps:**

1. **Notification Testing:**

   - Add a new product â†’ Check notification appears
   - Update a product â†’ Check update notification appears
   - Tap notifications â†’ Verify deep linking works

2. **Deep Link Testing:**
   - Test custom scheme URLs (`storeapp://`)
   - Test web URLs (`https://storeapp.com`)
   - Test from external apps (browser, messages, etc.)
